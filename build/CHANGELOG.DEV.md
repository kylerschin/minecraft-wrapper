Build 113.1
___________________________________________________
(backports of critical or useful features and bugfixes from development):
___________________________________________________
- Fix player permissions problems with setting groups for new players using setGroup().
- Fix buggy window inventory management system.
- Fixed 2 main sources of UUID problems and player object problems from 1) proxy logons causing premature "player.login"
and 2) assisting wrapper by populating eids and player locations from server console login readout.
- Disable entity processing which was continuously loading wrapper on an ongoing basis with entity data that was never dumped or trimmed.

Builds - 112 - 113:
- experimental pre-releases of build #114
- A dead end branch, but one that generally performs quite well in gameplay (does not suffer much lag).

Build #111:
- Added dashboard.py - beginning work on Dashboard rewrite using Flask + SocketIO

Build #110:
- [pull request #269] Bug fixes by sasszem
- based on build 109 with all current pull requests as of 1/30/2016
- updated md5 to hashlib in a few places (md5 is deprecated)
- Updated the Player.chatbox event to allow the chat to modified.  Also upgraded it to handle UTF-8 and special
		characters in chat.
- added to api.minecraft: getTimeofDay(self, format=0)
		# 0 = ticks, 1 = Military, else = civilian AM/PM, return -1 if no one on or server not started
		returns actual world time of day  (changes in server.py and API/minecraft.py)
- Added Chat.py plugin example...
- ..that utilizes the new abilty of "player.chatbox" event to accept plugin changes to chat.
- Added clock.py example for getTimeofDay()
- Lots of changes to proxy.py... Added mcpkt.py file for packet number references.  Packets are now referenced (in the
		play mode sections) by names, not hardcoded packet numbers.
- Added file mcpkt.py, where packet definitions are stored for reference by proxy.py.
- Beefed up player.interact event some to allow blocking of "interaction events" like lava and water placement, shooting, etc
